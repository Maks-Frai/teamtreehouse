      <p>I started my career as an SEO specialist at the Webcom Media Group marketing agency in 2017. I started as a Junoir, and within 2.5 years I grew to a Middle+ position. I managed more than 30 commercial projects in the company, mostly online stores and service sites.</p>
      <p>I gained a lot of experience as well as great cases on my resume.</p>

      <td style="width: 50%;">
      <p>iMarket Trade is a group of companies that deals with online sales through online stores. I came here as an inhouse employee to set up site optimization processes and increase organic traffic.</p>
      <p>In a year of work I have achieved excellent results, but a little tired of online sales and online stores.</p>
      <p>I wanted to do something else.</p>

      <p>I can't name my current place of work because it's secret information. But I want to tell you that I have been working here for more than 2 years and we deal with products in the iGaming niche.</p>
      <p>I really like what I'm doing now and I really feel at ease.</p>
